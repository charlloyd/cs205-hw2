#2. Analysis of Parallel Algorithms [10%]
1. Define iso-efficiency function for an ideally scalable parallel system.

2. Scaled speed-up is defined as the speedup obtained when the problem size is increased linearly with the number of processing elements; that is, if W is chosen as a base problem size for a single processing element, then $$scaled speedup = \frac{pW}{T_p(pW, p)}$$

For the problem of adding $n$ numbers on $p$ processing elements, assume that it takes 20 time units to communicate a 
number between two processing elements, and that it takes one unit of time to add two numbers. Plot the 
standard speedup curve for the base problem size p = 1, n = 256 and compare it with the scaled speedup 
curve with $p = 2^2, 2^4, 2^5, 2^8$.
